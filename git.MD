# git 
Version Control: is a system that allows you to revisit various versions 
of a file or set of files by recording changes

## what is Git:
1. is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version
of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the 
file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

2. Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git.
And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

3. Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. 
Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
