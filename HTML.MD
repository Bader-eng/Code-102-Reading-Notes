# HTML
## DOCTYPE :
tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).
## id attribute:
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page
## Class attribute :
Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. 
# Escape Characters:
1. There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets)
2. Therefore, if you want these characters to appear on your page you need to use what are termed "escape" characters (also known as escape codes or entity references)
3. There are also special codes that can be used to show symbols such as copyright and trademark, currency symbols, mathematical characters, and some punctuation marks.
### example:
1. Pound sign :&pound; &#163
2. Less-than sign: &lt;   &#60;
3. Cent sign:&cent;&#162;
4. Copyright symbol &copy;&#169;
