# How do computers work?
1. As the pioneers of computer science explore how to design a thinking machine,they realized that it had to perform four different tasks.
It would need to take input,store information process it and then output the results. 

2. input :You can tell computers what to dowith the keyboard mouse, 
the microphone, the camera touchscreen All these different inputs give a computer
information, which is then stored in memory.
3. A computer's processor: takes information from memory It manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm,
which is just a series of commands.
And then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again.
This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.
