# How do computers work?
1. As the pioneers of computer science explore how to design a thinking machine,they realized that it had to perform four different tasks.
It would need to take input,store information process it and then output the results. 

2. input :You can tell computers what to dowith the keyboard mouse, 
the microphone, the camera touchscreen All these different inputs give a computer
information, which is then stored in memory.
3. A computer's processor: takes information from memory It manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm,
which is just a series of commands.
And then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again.
This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.
4. How a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do
A computer display can show text, photos, videos, or interactive games -- even virtual reality!

## logic circuit:
A logic circuit is a circuit that executes a processing or controlling function in a computer.  This circuit implements logical operations on information to process it.
Logic circuits utilise two values for a given physical quantity (voltage, for example) to denote the Boolean values true and false or 1 and 0 respectively.  Logic circuits have inputs, as well as having outputs which can be dependent on the inputs.  In logic circuit diagrams, connection from one circuit’s output to another circuit’s input is displayed as an arrowhead at the input end.


## how input travels through a computer and becomes output.
1. When you press a key on your keyboard - let's say the letter "B". The keyboard converts the letter to a number.
2. That number is sent as binary, ones and zeros, into the computer.
3. Starting from this number, the CPU calculates how to display the letter "B" pixel by pixel.
4. The CPU requests step-by-step instructions from memory, which tell it how to draw the letter "B".
5. The CPU runs these instructions and stores the results as pixels in memory.
6. Finally, this pixel information is sent in binary to the screen.
7. The screen is an output device, which converts the binary signals into the tiny lights and colors that make up what you see.
