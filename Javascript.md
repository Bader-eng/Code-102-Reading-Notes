# Java Script
##HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER :
1. html files: This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page struct ure and adds semantics.
2. css files : he CSS enhances t he HTML page with rules that state how the HTML 
content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).
3. js files : This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. 
We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.

# BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS :
1. STATEMENTS :A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.
2. Comments :You should write comments to explain what your code does. 
They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.
3. MULTI-LINE COMMENTS : Multi-line comments are often used for descriptions of how the script works, or to prevent 
section of the script from running when testing it. To write a comment that stretches over more than one line, 
you use a multi-line comment, starting with the /* characters and ending with the * / characters.
4. Variables : JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. 
the data stored in a variable can change its follow for example “ var name = data “ 

## Data Type:
1. NUMERIC : The numeric data type handles numbers.
2. STRING : The strings data type consists of letters and other characters.
3. BOOLEAN : Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false
