# color
## Foreground Color
### The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three way:
1. rgb values
2. hex Codes
3. Color names
## Background Color:
you can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names 

## Understanding Color:
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker
1. RGB Values :values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. 
2. Hex Codes : Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.
3. Color Name : Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
4. saturation Ratio : Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, 
there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.
# Css3 :
1. opacity : the opacityproperty which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. 
2. rgba : property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity.
3. Hue : Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color,
although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
4. Saturation: is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
5. hsl:
The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors. 
The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside parentheses for:
hue,saturation,lightness,alpha.
