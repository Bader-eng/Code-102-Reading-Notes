# Growth mindset
The growth mindset for me is for a person to face what he feels of fears and for a person to look at 
himself and determine what his fears are and what prevents him from developing and advancing in the 
field of work, study and social life and the mentality of growth is not only for program developers or in a 
field of work, but it is a phrase It is about a **way of life**, it is a way to start and end your day from the 
beginning of your awakening until the time your sleep, many internal causes in ourselves or our 
surroundings prevent us from developing, and humans by nature tend to hide behind easy, simple and 
fun things that do not require effort or make a decision or admit a mistake And to learn from it.
the person who wants to change and move forward and want to change his future must know that he
can only get what he wants by facing challenges and possessing passion, ambition and challenge.

## The difference between growth mindset and fixed mindset
1. A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort.
2. in fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone,
   without the need for further development or effort.

## compare between growth mindset and fixed mindset:
