My name is Badr Al Shawabkeh, a mechanical engineer, interested in developing software, blockchain, and everything related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution
In these, I present to you some of the topics that are concerned with the development of programs.

### The growth mindset for me is for a person to face what he feels of fears and for a person to look at himself and determine what his fears are and what prevents him from developing and advancing in the field of work, study and social life and the mentality of growth is not only for program developers or in a field of work, but it is a phrase It is about a way of life, it is a way to start and end your day from the beginning of your awakening until the time your sleep, many internal causes in ourselves or our surroundings prevent us from developing, and humans by nature tend to hide behind easy, simple and fun things that do not require effort or make a decision or admit a mistake And to learn from it. the person who wants to change and move forward and want to change his future must know that he can only get what he wants by facing challenges and possessing passion, ambition and challenge.
