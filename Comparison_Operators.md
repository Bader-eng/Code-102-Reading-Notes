## avaScript supports different kinds of loops:
1. for - loops through a block of code a number of times
2. for/in - loops through the properties of an object
3. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
4. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
5. do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

# the For Loop
The for loop has the following syntax:
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
